# Data Analysis Portfolio

## About me
After six enriching years in sales and recruitment support, I decided to pivot and explore the world of data. I completed an intensive data analysis bootcamp followed by a six-month internship, where I had the opportunity to apply my skills in a real-world setting.

Throughout this journey, I developed a solid foundation in Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI, and explored the basics of machine learning, including techniques like K-Nearest Neighbors and linear regression. During my internship, I also gained hands-on experience with CRM tools such as Snowflake and Salesforce, expanding my understanding of data workflows in a business environment.

This portfolio showcases my personal projects, which Iâ€™ve built as part of my continuous learning process.

## Jewelry Business Follow-up Dashboard

### Aim : 

The goal of this project is to simulate a small business and identify key performance indicators (KPIs) that are essential for tracking its health and progress. With simple visualizations and clearly organized tabs, the dashboard enables business owners to easily monitor and understand key aspects of their operations.

The dashboard is built in Power BI and is fully interactive. Thanks to the built-in Refresh function, any updates made to the underlying Excel files are automatically reflected in the dashboard, making it convenient and scalable for regular use.

### Limitations & Future Improvements :

This project was created for learning purposes and fun. Some data points were simplified or omitted, such as:

- Net profit and gross profit margins
- Customer demographics (e.g., addresses, gender)
- Detailed costs (raw materials, bills, etc.)

### Future improvements could include:

- Automating a Python script to retrieve real-time and historical metal prices via API
- Enhancing data completeness to support more accurate profitability metrics

### Skills & Tools Demonstrated :
- Data cleaning and transformation using Power Query
- Dashboard creation and design in Power BI
- Business-focused data storytelling
- API usage in Python to retrieve daily metal prices
